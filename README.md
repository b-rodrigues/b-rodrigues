My name is Bruno Rodrigues and hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Strasbourg.

I’m currently employed as a statistician for the Ministry of Research and Higher Education in Luxembourg.
Before that I was senior data scientist and then manager in the data science team at PwC Luxembourg, 
and before that I was a research assistant at STATEC Research.

My hobbies are boxing, lifting weights, cycling, cooking and reading or listening to audiobooks, which is more compatible with the life of a young father and watching movies.
I like blogging about R and statistics, you can read my [blog here](https://www.brodrigues.co/). I also teach a course about building
reproducible analytical pipeline with R, and you can the course notes for free [here](https://rap4mads.eu/).
